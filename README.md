### Reflection/TODO FIXES
    Week 1
    - add atoi example to week 1 slides
    
    Week 2
    - consider drawing lines to visualise branches (either in class or on slides)
    - Fix mips loop example missing branch back to condition

    Week 3
    - Update slides! a few mistakes in them
    - Consider combining q5/6/7 into one, and do q8 instead, they were way too similar
    - Improve hexidecimal explanation
    
    Week 4
    - Fix mistakes in slides
    - Ran low on time, potentially cull some information

    Week 8
    - Ran very under time, slow down explanation or fill in more content (chmod/fseek examples)
    - If assignment out early enough, quick planned overview
    - improve file permissions content

    Week 9
    - Timing was good
    - Execution of examples was not brilliant
    - Need to find a better balance between week 8 and 9 content to make both run
